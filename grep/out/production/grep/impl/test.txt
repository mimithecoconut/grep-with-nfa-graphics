Outfox!
once upon a time there was a chicken named JeffoJeffo the Jeffo.
the chicken was scared of Fox, a fox.
fox outfoxes all other foxes
she also likes to sit in boxes and fax things
she hates being called a f0x or foxfo or foxfoxfox
One day, the fox will outfox the chicken and eat it, finally concluding the chicken's reign of terror over the farmer's humble countryside. Never before had such an astonishing feat been done by a vixen like Fox, the fox
The end.
